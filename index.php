<h1>About Us:</h1>

<p>The women behind the B.E.E Workshops form a dynamic group of professionals called B.A.B.E. The groupâ€™s collective experience spans all areas of live event production from entertainment to corporate. With their varied education, years of real-world experience in multiple areas of the music industry and beyond, the group is ready to share their knowledge with their community. While they have a strong focus on growing the presence of women in the field of event production, they strive for an equal educational experience and encourage all to attend the B.E.E Workshop series. The group believes a comprehensive and equal learning environment will lead to an equal, efficient, and positive work environment.</p>
